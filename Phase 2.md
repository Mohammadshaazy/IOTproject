## Step 1: Selection of Microcontrollers
For our IoT-Based Environmental Monitoring project, we have carefully chosen the ESP32 microcontroller and Arduino UNO microcontroller. We made this selection based on their suitability for our project's specific requirements.

- The reason behind choosing these microcontrollers is that they align perfectly with our project's objectives. We need to collect and transmit temperature and humidity data and share it on a public platform. Therefore, the lightweight and efficient ESP32 and Arduino UNO microcontrollers are well-suited for our purposes.

## Step 2: Sensor Choice
We have opted for a Digital Humidity and Temperature Sensor to gather the environmental data required for our project accurately.

## Step 3: Connectivity Options
To ensure seamless data transmission, we will utilize multiple connectivity options:

- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for short-range communication.
- Wi-Fi for broader network coverage and internet connectivity.
- Zigbee for specific scenarios where Zigbee networks are preferred.

## Step 4: Cloud Integration
To manage and store the collected environmental data, we have chosen Beeceptor as our cloud platform. Beeceptor offers the necessary infrastructure to handle and process the data efficiently.

## Step 5: Data Communication Protocols
For efficient and secure data transfer, we will employ the following protocols:

- MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) for lightweight, real-time data communication.
- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for web-based data transmission.
- AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) for advanced message queuing and data exchange.

## Step 6: Public Platform Features
Our public platform will be designed with a focus on user-friendliness and accessibility. It will include features such as:

- Real-time display of temperature and humidity data.
- User-friendly interface for park visitors.
- Data visualization tools for better understanding of environmental conditions.
- Notifications and alerts for extreme weather conditions.
- Accessibility via web and mobile devices to cater to a wide user base.

The key decisions and details regarding the hardware, connectivity, cloud integration, communication protocols, and features of our IoT-Based Environmental Monitoring project. By combining the ESP32 and Arduino UNO microcontrollers with the selected sensor, connectivity options, and cloud platform, we aim to provide park visitors with valuable real-time environmental data through a user-friendly and feature-rich public platform, enhancing their overall park experience.
