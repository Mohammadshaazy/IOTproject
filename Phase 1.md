# Phase 1: Problem Definition and Design Thinking

In this part you will need to understand the problem statement and create a
document on what have you understood and how will you proceed ahead with
solving the problem. Please think on a design and present in form of a document.

**Project Definition:** The project involves setting up IoT devices to monitor
environmental conditions in public parks, including temperature and humidity.
The primary objective is to provide real-time environmental data to park visitors
through a public platform, enabling them to plan their outdoor activities
accordingly. This project includes defining objectives, designing the IoT sensor
system, developing the environmental monitoring platform, and integrating them
using IoT technology and Python.

## Design Thinking:

- **Project Objectives:** Define objectives such as real-time environmental
monitoring, aiding park visitors in activity planning, promoting outdoor
experiences, and enhancing visitor satisfaction.

- **IoT Devices Designs:** Plan the deployment of IoT sensors (e.g., temperature
and humidity sensors) in public parks.

- **Environmental Monitoring Platform:** Design a web-based platform to display
real time environmental data to the public.

- **Integration Approach:** Determine how IoT devices will send data to the
environmental monitoring platform.

## IoTBased Environmental Monitoring

This system will provide real-time environmental data to park visitors,
empowering them to make informed decisions for their outdoor activities. To
guide this project, we will adhere to the Design Thinking framework, ensuring
that it aligns with user needs and continuously evolves to deliver value.

### Project Objectives

Our project objectives are as follows:
- To provide park visitors with real-time environmental data, including
temperature and humidity.
- To aid park visitors in planning outdoor activities based on current
environmental conditions.
- To promote outdoor experiences in public parks by enhancing visitor
satisfaction through data-driven decision-making.

### Ideas
Our project team will engage in brainstorming sessions and ideation workshops
to generate creative concepts for the IoT-based environmental monitoring
system. We will leverage the insights gathered during the empathy phase to
inspire innovative solutions.

- **Define:** Having understood stakeholder needs and generated creative ideas,
we will clearly define our project objectives, as stated earlier.
- **Test:** Throughout the project's lifecycle, we will establish feedback loops and
iterative problem-solving mechanisms to refine the project continually.
Feedback from park visitors and other stakeholders will be integral to this
process.

### Prototype
We will create prototypes for both the IoT sensor deployment and the
environmental monitoring platform:
- **IoT Devices Design:** We will develop a prototype for deploying IoT sensors
(temperature and humidity) in public parks, ensuring cost-effectiveness and
energy efficiency.
- **Environmental Monitoring Platform:** A web-based or mobile-based platform
prototype will be designed to display real-time environmental data to the
public, focusing on user-friendliness and accessibility.

### Implementation Plan
- **Scope and Timeline:** The project scope includes implementing the IoT-based
system in given time period.
- **Budget and Resource Allocation:** The estimated budget for this project is more
than around 3000 rupees. Resources, including hardware, software
development, and personnel.

### Evaluation and Feedback
We will establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure project success,
including visitor engagement and satisfaction levels. Regular evaluations and
adjustments based on collected data and user feedback will ensure the project's
continuous improvement.

### Sustainability and Future Expansion
We are committed to the long-term sustainability of this system. Maintenance
plans for IoT devices and the monitoring platform will be documented.
Additionally, we will explore opportunities for expanding the system to more
parks or incorporating additional environmental parameters.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, our project, "IoT-Based Environmental Monitoring," aims to
transform the way people enjoy public parks. By implementing a user-centric
approach rooted in the Design Thinking framework, we will provide park visitors
with valuable, real-time environmental data.
